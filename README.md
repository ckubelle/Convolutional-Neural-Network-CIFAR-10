# Convolutional Neural Network CIFAR 10
 A convolutional neural network that is able to distinguish images and classify them into ten different categories.\
 Overall, the model was able to achieve an accuracy of 72%
 
 Modules used include:\
 Tensorflow\
 Keras\
 Matplotlib\
 TensorBoard
 
 The dataset used in this project was the CIFAR-10 Dataset which is a dataset composed of 60,000 images.\
 Since there are ten categories in the dataset, each category is composed of 6,000 images.\
 You can find more about the dataset here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html  
 
 
 The model categorized images into the following ten categories:\
 airplane\
 automobile\
 bird\
 cart\
 deer\
 dog\
 frog\
 horse\
 ship\
 truck
